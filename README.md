# :man_student: Computer Science College Student at UFRGS

- <p align="justify"> 💬 Hello, my name is Erick. Nice to meet you! I am twenty-one years old and a computer science college student at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. The area of computer science fascinates me. My grandfather, who is still a programmer, introduced it to me. However, I studied Applied Mathematics for a year before switching majors. </p>
- <p align="justify"> ☕ Java is my favorite programming language. Yes, I actually enojoy its verbose syntax. Moreover, I am addicted to coffee. Bitter, black coffee with cinnamon powder is my weakness. </p>
- <p align="justify"> 📚 As I am a college student and the course covers both software and hardware, I also have experience with C, C++, Python, Haskell, Verilog, Assembly, LaTeX and even Fortran. Nevertheless, out of all the languages mentioned, I am only comfortable with C, C++, Java, Python and LaTeX. I mostly used C, C++ and Java throughout college. I also know object oriented programming. Since I use multiple langauges, I use Visual Studio Code. </p>
- <p align="justify"> 🌐 Portuguese is my mother language, but I am also fluent in English (C2 Level) and know some French. I use Portuguese for my college repositories and English for basically everything else. </p>
- <p align="justify"> 🌠 As a computer scientists in the making, I understand that I need a good understanding of both software and hardware, front-end and back-end. This is why I plan on focusing on C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, LaTeX, the MySQL databse and the Django framework. I am constantly studying and practicing languages and concepts outside of college. </p>
