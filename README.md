- üí¨ Hello, my name is Erick. Nice to meet you! I am twenty-one years old and a computer science college student.
- ‚ú® The area of computer science fascinates me and my grandfather, who is still a programmer, introduced it to me.
- ‚òï Java is my favorite programming language. Moreover, I am addicted to coffee. The more bitter it is, the better the taste.
- üêç I also enjoy the Python programming language and will not hesitate to use when necessary.
- :man_student: While I mostly use Java and Python, I also know Ruby, C and C++, but I am not as fluent in them as I am in Java or Python.
- :book: I also know a lot about LaTeX and I use it a lot in college.
- üåê Portuguese is my mother language, but I am also fluent in English (C2 Level) and know some French.
