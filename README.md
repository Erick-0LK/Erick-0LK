# :man_student: Computer Science College Student at UFRGS

- <p align="justify"> üí¨ Hello, my name is Erick. Nice to meet you! I am twenty-one years old and a computer science college student. The area of computer science fascinates me. My grandfather, who is still a programmer, introduced it to me. However, I studied Applied Mathematics for a year before switching majors. </p>
- <p align="justify"> ‚òï Java is my favorite programming language. Yes, I actually enojoy its verbose syntax. Moreover, I am addicted to coffee. Bitter, black coffee with cinnamon powder is my weakness. </p>
- <p align="justify"> üìö As I am a college student, I also have experience with C, C++, Python, Haskell, Verilog, Assembly, LaTeX and even Fortran. Nevertheless, out of all the languages mentioned, I only really know Java, Python, C and LaTeX. Moreoever, I also know object oriented programming. </p>
- <p align="justify"> üåê Portuguese is my mother language, but I am also fluent in English (C2 Level) and know some French. I use Portuguese for my college repositories and English for basically everything else. </p>
