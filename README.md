- 💬 Hello, my name is Erick. Nice to meet you! I am twenty-one years old and a computer science college student.
- ✨ The area of computer science fascinates me. My grandfather, who is still a programmer, introduced it to me.
- ☕ Java is my favorite programming language. Moreover, I am addicted to coffee. The more bitter it is, the better the taste.
- 🐍 I also enjoy the Python programming language and will not hesitate to use when necessary.
- :man_student: I also have experience with C, C++, Ruby, Haskell, Verilog, Assembly and LaTeX, mostly due to college.
- :books: However, out of all the languages mentioned, I only know a lot of Java, Python, C and LaTeX.
- 🌐 Portuguese is my mother language, but I am also fluent in English (C2 Level) and know some French.
