# :man_student: Computer Science University Student at UFRGS

- <p align = "justify"> 💬 Hello, my name is Erick. Nice to meet you! I am twenty-one years old and a computer science university student at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. The area of computer science fascinates me. My grandfather, who is still a programmer, introduced it to me. However, I studied Applied Mathematics for a year before switching majors. </p>
- <p align = "justify"> 📚 As I am a university student and the course covers both software and hardware, I have had experiences with a wide variety of programming langugages. However, I am more comfortable with C, C++, Python and Java, but mostly the latter two. I also know LaTeX and object oriented programming. Since I use multiple langauges, I use Visual Studio Code. Nevertheless, I have had experiences with other IDEs, such as Visual Studio, Eclipse and PyCharm, but mostly Visual Studio.</p>
- <p align = "justify"> 🌐 Portuguese is my mother language, but I am also fluent in English (C2) and know some French (A1). I use Portuguese for my university repositories or other courses which I do here and English for basically everything else. </p>
- <p align = "justify"> 🌠 As a computer scientist in the making and an aspiring back-end developer, I plan on focusing on Java, Python, HTML, LaTeX, SQL and Django. I am constantly studying and practicing languages and concepts outside of college. </p>
